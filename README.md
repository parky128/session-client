      ALSession.deactivateSession();

**isSessionActive**

Boolean check to see if the session data itself is verified as potentially valid.

**setUserAuthentication**

Sets the authenticated user details

      ALSession.setUserAuthentication(proposal);

## Interactive

Loads the library into memory and stays in an interactive node shell.
  
      npm run interactive

After running this command you can access the `ALSession` object and call methods directly on it.

## Tests

      npm test

or to watch for code changes and re-run tests:

      npm test-watch

An auto-generated `coverage` directory will be produced which will contain a browsable HTML report

## Contributing

The sources are written in Typescript and follow the tslint [airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tslint-config-airbnb) style.

## Building

To generate a production build

    npm run build

To generate a development build for local testing - non minified, concatenated only

    npm run build-dev

Builds will be be generated into a `dist` folder and will contain commonjs and umd bundles that will be consumed depending on the module system in whichever environment you are using.
